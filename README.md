# üöÄ Projects

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Chance of Admission Prediction
**Description:**  
Predicts the probability of a student getting admission into graduate programs using **Linear Regression** based on GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and Research Experience.  

**Tools & Libraries:**  
- Google Colab  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)  

**Model Performance:**  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAPE): ~7.5%

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnosing Diabetes in Female Patients
**Description:**  
Predicts whether a female patient is likely to have diabetes using medical features such as Glucose, BMI, Insulin levels, and Age.  
A **Logistic Regression** model is trained after imputing missing values.  

**Tools & Libraries:**  
- Google Colab  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, missingno, matplotlib)  

**Model Performance:**  
- Accuracy: ~74%

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chance of Admission Prediction (KNN Regressor)
**Description:**
Predicts the probability of a student getting admission into graduate programs based on GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and Research experience.
A **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor** (KNN) model is trained to estimate admission chances as a continuous score.

**Tools & Libraries:**  
- Google Colab  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, missingno, matplotlib)

**Model Performance:**
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): ~9.5%

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnosing Diabetes in Female Patients (KNN Classifier)
**Description:**  
Predicts whether a female patient is diabetic (Yes/No) using medical features such as Glucose, BMI, Insulin levels, Blood Pressure, and Age.
A **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier** (KNN) model is trained after imputing missing values in the dataset.  

**Tools & Libraries:**  
- Google Colab  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, missingno, matplotlib)  

**Model Performance:**  
- Accuracy: ~74%
